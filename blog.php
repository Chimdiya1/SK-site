                                    A wise man once said ‘Every Crisis opens doors to New Opportunities’. <br>

The Year 2020 has been a roller coaster ride by far. The Covid-19 crisis has brought many challenges that one 
has to overcome. Probably this has been the most life changing experience with regards to personal, 
social, economical and financial aspects. Second and third quarters of this year have  been the talking
 point for most of us in light of the entire globe locking down on the day to day activities. While
  businesses and the economy have certainly come to a standstill, there has been a major change in 
  many of the aspects in our personal lives as well. 

‘The only way to make sense out of a change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance’

                                <p>
                                    Haven’t we all at least once in our lifetime been skeptical about availing a personal loan
									 to meet financial shortcomings? Yes, Certainly! This is because personal loan may be 
									 misconceived as an expensive debt instrument. As far as possible, we try to use credit 
									 cards to fill the gaps created in an unmanaged budget. But did you know, credit cards 
									 are actually more expensive than personal loans!

Many misconceptions like these become deterrents for availing these debt instruments! This article aims at decoding various 
deceiving notions that are associated with a Personal loan.
